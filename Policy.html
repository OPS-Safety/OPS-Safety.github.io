                By using our services, you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, please refrain from using our services.</i></p>

            <h3 style = "text-align: center"> <b> 3. User Privacy and Data Protection</b></h3>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Data Collection</b></li>
                <p>To provide an optimal experience, OPS-Safety collects the following data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Location Data:</b> Real-time user location data is collected to provide accurate information on nearby dangerous zones.</li> <br>
                    <li><b>Device Information:</b> We may collect device identifiers, operating system information, and mobile network information for performance improvement.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Usage Data:</b> Information on how users interact with our Service may be collected for analytics and service improvement.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li><b>Data Use</b></li>
                <p>OPS-Safety strictly uses data to improve the quality of the Service. User data is utilized to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhance map accuracy based on user interactions.</li><br>
                    <li>Improve the overall Service experience.</li><br>
                    <li>Personalize the Service based on user preferences.</li>
                </ul><br>
                
                <li><b>Non-Commercial Use of Data</b></li>
                <p>OPS-Safety values user privacy and is committed to not using or sharing any user data for monetary gain. Under no circumstances will user data be sold, rented, or shared with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>
                
                <li><b>Data Security</b></li>
                <p>OPS-Safety employs appropriate security measures to protect user data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. While we strive to keep user data secure, no system can be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute data security.</p>
                
                <li><b>User Data Retention</b></li>
                <p>OPS-Safety retains user data only as long as necessary for service improvement, legal obligations, or dispute resolution. 
                   Users may request deletion of their personal data by contacting <br> [<ins style="color:blue">contact@ops-safety.com].</ins></p>
            </ol>
            <h3 style = "text-align: center"> <b> 4. Location Accuracy</b></h3>
            <p> OPS-Safety relies on user-provided location data, police reports, and geolocation data to identify dangerous zones. 
              When an <ins><i>Alert Report Form</i></ins> is submitted by a user, it is first sent to the nearest police station for verification. Only after confirmation from law enforcement does the location marker appear on the map. 
              This ensures that information displayed is as accurate and reliable as possible. However, users are still advised to exercise caution and take appropriate safety measures when
              navigating through flagged zones, as conditions may change rapidly.</p>
            <h3 style = "text-align: center"> <b> 5. User Responsibilities</b></h3>
            <p>Users agree to use OPS-Safety for lawful purposes only. Users are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Notifying OPS-Safety of any inaccuracies or issues in data they notice.</li><br>
                <li>Exercising caution and discretion in using the Service.</li><br>
                <li>Refraining from sharing their OPS-Safety account information with others.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style = "text-align: center"> <b> 6. Changes to the Terms and Conditions</b></h3>
            <p> OPS-Safety reserves the right to update or modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the “Last Updated” date will be revised. 
                Your continued use of the Service after changes have been posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible button">How does O.P.S safety ensure that user data stays private and protected?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p> <i>User privacy is highly valued at O.P.S Safety. As such, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of user privacy. Under
                   no circumstances does our company collect user data through our servers for monetary gain. OPS-Safety takes data protection seriously. 
                   Your location data is encrypted and securely stored in compliance with industry standards and legal requirements. 
                   It is only accessible to authorized personnel who need it to maintain and improve the service. 
                   Additionally, we do not share your personal data with third parties without your explicit consent.</i></p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible button">What data does OPS-Safety collect from users, and why?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p> <i>OPS-Safety collects data primarily to provide accurate and up-to-date information about potentially dangerous zones near you. 
              This includes location data and information from public police reports. We collect only what is necessary to deliver relevant alerts and improve our service. 
              Your privacy is our priority, and we never collect data unrelated to enhancing the service experience.</i></p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible button">How can you guarantee that information from <i>Alert Report Forms</i> is accurate?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p> <i> We understand your concern about the possibility of false reports being submitted for various reasons. Our service is directly linked to regional police stations. 
              Like an anonymous report system, this setup ensures that whenever a report is made, it first alerts the nearest police station. 
              The location marker only appears on the map after the station verifies the danger. This way, a location is marked only when professionals are already on-site or 
              on their way to control the situation. This ensures that the information displayed is as accurate as possible.</i></p>

        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible button">Does OPS-Safety sell my personal data to third parties?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p> <i>No, OPS-Safety does not sell, trade, or monetize your personal data in any way. 
              We believe that user data should be used strictly for improving your safety experience on our platform and not as a source of revenue. 
              Any data we collect is used solely to enhance our services and provide accurate safety information.</i></p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible button">Will OPS-Safety continue to track me when I am not using the app?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p> <i>No, OPS-Safety only accesses your location data when the app is actively being used to show nearby dangerous zones. When you close the app, 
              we stop tracking your location, and no background data is collected.</i></p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible button">Can I delete my data from OPS-Safety?</button>
        <div class="content">

        <button type="button" class="collapsible button">Can I use OPS-Safety without sharing my location?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p> <i>To provide you with relevant and accurate information about nearby dangerous zones, OPS-Safety requires location data.
